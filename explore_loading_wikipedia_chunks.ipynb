      "[CLS] it was here in 1861 that abraham lincoln met a little girl named grace bedell, who, during the preceding year's presidential campaign, urged lincoln by letter to grow his beard out fully as an attempt to improve his chances at being elected. lincoln responded by brief letter thanking grace for the suggestion. he made no promises but shortly afterwards allowed his beard to grow, and by the time he began his inaugural journey by train from illinois to washington, d. c., he had a full beard. the trip took him through new york state, and included a stop in westfield, where thousands gathered to meet the president - elect. lincoln asked by name to meet grace bedell.

      "[CLS] according to historian william e. barton, a rumor \" current in various forms in several sections of the south \" was that lincoln's biological father was abraham enloe, which barton dismissed as \" false \". according to doug wead, enloe made a public boast that he was lincoln's real father, and thomas lincoln allegedly fought him, biting off a piece of his nose. another claim was that lincoln was \" part negro \", but that was unproven. according to lincoln's law partner william h. herndon, lincoln had \" very dark skin \" although \" his cheeks were leathery and saffron - colored \" and \" his face was... sallow, \" and \" his hair was dark, almost black \". abraham lincoln described himself c. 1838 â€“ 39 as a \" long black fellow \" and his \" complexion \" in 1859 as \" dark \", but whether he meant either in an ancestral sense is unknown. the anti - lincoln charleston mercury described him as being \" of... the dirtiest complexion \", as part of anti - abolitionist race - baiting. rumors of lincoln's alleged black racial heritage are considered unsubstantiated and have not been acknowledged by historians.
