      "Glacier caves, also known as moulins or ice caves, are formed in glaciers due to the melting of ice. Here's a simplified explanation of the process:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Meltwater: As snow accumulates on a glacier, it eventually turns into ice. Over time, this ice melts due to various factors like geothermal heat, precipitation, and air temperature. This meltwater collects in crevasses and other low spots within the glacier.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Enlargement of crevasses: The meltwater continues to flow, enlarging the crevasses. As the crevasse deepens, it may eventually connect with the surface of the glacier, forming a vertical shaft known as a moulin.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Drainage: The meltwater drains into the underlying rock or bedrock, carving out a tunnel or cave-like structure. This process continues as long as the conditions (temperature, precipitation, etc.) allow for melting and drainage.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Collapse: Over time, the roof of the cave may become too thin to support itself, causing it to collapse. This can create a large, open cavity within the glacier.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Exposure: If the glacier retreats or melts away, the cave may be exposed to the surface, allowing people to explore it. However, these caves are dangerous and should only be entered by experienced climbers and cavers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 + RAG\n",
      "Glacier caves are formed by melting ice and flowing water within and under glaciers. This process is often initiated by water running through or under the glacier, which originates on the glacier's surface through melting, enters the ice at a moulin, and exits at the glacier's snout at base level. Heat transfer from the water can cause sufficient melting to create an air-filled cavity, sometimes aided by solifluction. Air movement can then assist enlargement through melting in summer and sublimation in winter.\n",
