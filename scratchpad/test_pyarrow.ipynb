      "<class 'list'> <class 'str'> [CLS] potassium is the major cation ( positive ion ) inside animal cells, while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells. the concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells, known as the membrane potential. the balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion transporter proteins in the cell membrane. the cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an action potential — a \" spike \" of electrical discharge. the ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and heart function. disruption of this balance may thus be fatal : for example, ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to hyperkalemia strongly influencing the cardiovascular system. potassium chloride is used in the united states for lethal injection executions.

      "<class 'list'> <class 'str'> [CLS] when an action potential reaches a presynaptic terminal, it activates the synaptic transmission process. the first step is rapid opening of calcium ion channels in the membrane of the axon, allowing calcium ions to flow inward across the membrane. the resulting increase in intracellular calcium concentration causes synaptic vesicles ( tiny containers enclosed by a lipid membrane ) filled with a neurotransmitter chemical to fuse with the axon's membrane and empty their contents into the extracellular space. the neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic nerve through exocytosis. the neurotransmitter chemical then diffuses across to receptors located on the membrane of the target cell. the neurotransmitter binds to these receptors and activates them. depending on the type of receptors that are activated, the effect on the target cell can be to excite the target cell, inhibit it, or alter its metabolism in some way. this entire sequence of events often takes place in less than a thousandth of a second. afterward, inside the presynaptic terminal, a new set of vesicles is moved into position next to the membrane, ready to be released when the next action potential arrives. the action potential is the final electrical step in the integration of synaptic messages at the scale of the neuron.
